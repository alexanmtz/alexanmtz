### Hi there 👋, I'm Alexandre Magno, a senior software engineer currently at Banking Circle

A little about me:

- 🔭 I’m currently working at Banking Circle as a Senior Software Engineer
- 🏠 I'm from Teófilo Otoni, Minas Gerais, Brazil, a small city in the countryside
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Github Actions, GraphQL and playing around with Open AI
- 👯 I've been working with app development, payment API's, and now banking operations and high-scale frontend development.
- 💻 I’m looking to collaborate on Open-Source Software with Gitpay (https://gitpay.me)
- 📖 I’m always learning, especially because there are more JS frameworks than people :p
- 💬 Ask me about science

- ⚡ Fun fact: I re-created the software Lucifer, which answers all your questions - http://lucifer-msdos.com

### Some conferences I've been speaking:

- In 2007, I had the opportunity to present my first paper at [FISL](https://fisl.softwarelivre.org/17-papers?locale=en). It was entitled "Integrating Unsupervised Learning Techniques into Text Clustering Evaluation" and discussed the use of machine learning in clustering text data.

- In 2009, I participated in [Fórum DOS 4.0](https://fisl12.softwarelivre.org/?lang=en). I gave a presentation called "How to Code an Artificial Intlligence in 30 Minutes", where I demonstrated how easy it is to create a chatbot using Javascript.

- In 2011, I returned to [FISL](https://fisl.softwarelivre.org/) as a speaker. My presentation was titled "Playing with Worlds, Musical Brains, and the Bits of Machines", where I talked about my experience creating the software [Lucifer](http://lucifer-msdos.com). 

- In 2013, I expanded my reach and spoke at [Devoxx France](https://devoxx.fr/) with a talk called "Looping the Universe: Constructing a Virtual Trip into Programs". It was all about exploring the infinite possibilities of code and programming.

- More recently, in 2016, I spoke at [Code::Dive](https://codedive.pl/) in Poland. My presentation was titled "Programmable Musicians: Generating Music Patterns with Computers", where I discussed the use of machine learning in generating complex musical patterns.

And That's my activity:
