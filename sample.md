A little about me:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Github Actions, GraphQL and playing around with Open AI
- 👯 I've been working with app development, payment API's, and now banking operations and high-scale front-ends
- 💻 I’m looking to collaborate on Open-Source Software with Gitpay (https://gitpay.me)
- 📖 I’m always learning, especially because there are more JS frameworks than people :p
- 💬 Ask me about science
